### What the project is about
This project is about using the HTML skills I just learned and making a website from it. This website features pages of my favorite recipes.  
### Workflow
- Create a list recipe directory on my machine
- Add a html file called `index` to that directory 
- Then created another directory called recipes and created another html file called grilledcheese and chickenpotpie
- Added the html boilerplate to all three files. Then gave the index file a title, a summary, and linked it with the other two.
-  `grilledcheese.html` and `chickenpotpie` both contain:
    1. An `h1` heading with the recupe's name as its content
    2. An image of the finished dish under the `h1` heading
    3. A description heading with the `h2` element followed by a paragraph describing the recipe
    4. An ingredients heading `h3` followed by an unordered ingredients needed for the recipe
    5. Lasly, under the ingreidents list, add an `h3` heading called steps followed by an ordered list
  
### Files & Purpose
- `index.html` - Contains the root file and links all other files
- `grilledcheese.html` - Contains the recipe to my amazing bacon and onion grilled cheese sandwich
- `chickenpotpie.html` - Contains the recipe to my family favorite chicken potpie
