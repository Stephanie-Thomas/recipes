    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 2 servings</p>  
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoond unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 pound of yellow onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sherry, red-wine or white-wine veinegar (optional)</li>
            <li>4 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated</li>
            <li>4 slices bread, cut no wider than 1/2-inch thick </li>
   
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol> <!--ordered list tag for steps to -->
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. 
            Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. 

            <li>Uncover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            If the onions look dry or like they might burn, add a few tablespoons of water at a time, scraping up any 
            browned bits that are stuck to the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        
            <li><b>(Optional)</b> Once the onions are done, deglaze the
            skillet with vinegar and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute. Transfer the onions to a 
            medium bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Wipe out the skillet, or wash it, if necessary.</li>

             <li>Add the cheese to the onions and stir to combine. Put down two slices of bread, and scoop half of the cheese-onion mixture onto each one. 
                Top with the remaining slices of bread, and press down gently. </li>

            <li>In the skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the sandwiches and cook until the bottoms turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, 
            reducing the heat to prevent toast from darkening too quickly, if needed. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, 
            flip the sandwiches, press down and cook until the cheese has fully melted and the bottoms turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
